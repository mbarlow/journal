# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a journal application project currently in its initial stages. The repository contains:
- An empty `index.html` file that will serve as the main entry point
- MIT License
- Basic README

## Development Status

The project is in its initial setup phase with no established build system, dependencies, or testing framework yet. When implementing features, consider:

1. **Frontend Framework Choice**: No framework has been chosen yet. Consider whether to use vanilla JavaScript or a framework based on user requirements.

2. **Build System**: No build tools are currently configured. May need to set up based on the technology choices made.

3. **Testing**: No test framework is in place. Will need to be established as the project develops.

## Architecture Notes

As this is a greenfield project, architectural decisions should be made based on user requirements for the journal application. Key considerations for a journal app typically include:
- Data storage approach (local storage, IndexedDB, or backend service)
- User authentication requirements
- Entry organization and search capabilities
- Privacy and security considerations for personal journal data
